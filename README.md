# cutups
A website letting the user try the Cut-Up technique of manipulating text, as popularized by William S. Burroughs.

A live version is hosted here on github paged: [cutups](https://bliden.github.io/cutups/).

### How it works:

Type or paste in the text that you want to work with, choose your options, and hit submit.

__chunk size__: 
    sets how many consecutive words get scrambled together. The source text is broken into these chunks before processing.Defaults to 2 words.

__shuffle__: 
 toggles whether or not shuffling of your word chunks will happen. Default: true.

__reverse__: 
 toggles reversal of your source text before being chunked. Can lead to some interesting results! Default: false.
